# Capstone-Project_Global-Power-Plant-Trends-Insights-for-Energy-Transition

## 1.	Introduction

The global energy landscape is at a turning point. While nations pledge to cut carbon emissions and accelerate the shift toward sustainable power, fossil fuels continue to dominate electricity generation worldwide. This imbalance highlights both the urgency of transition and the scale of opportunity.
By analyzing the Global Power Plant Database (2013–2017), we uncover where renewable energy is advancing, where fossil reliance persists, and how these trends shape investment, policy, and advocacy. For stakeholders—policy makers, investors, and NGOs—this data provides the clarity needed to plan strategically, allocate resources wisely, and drive meaningful progress toward a sustainable energy future.
2.	Problem Statement
Energy data is vital for guiding policy, investment, and sustainability decisions. Yet despite global commitments to cut carbon emissions, power generation remains dominated by fossil fuels. Stakeholders lack accessible, visual insights that show where the energy transition is advancing—or stalling—making it harder to plan, invest, and advocate effectively.

## 3.	Objective

To analyze the global distribution, composition, and evolution of power plants using the Global Power Plant Database, and to develop insights that enables stakeholders—particularly policymakers, investors, and NGOs—to:
-	Understand the current energy mix and infrastructure by country and region
-	Identify trends in renewable vs. non-renewable energy development over time
-	Support data-driven decision-making for energy transition strategies

## 4.	Target Audiences

-	Policy Makers/ Regulators
-	Business Leaders/Investors
-	Academics/NGOs
